# Money Dashboard

A web-based record keeper for current accounts, budgets, savings and investments. Supports multiple currencies and includes tools for UK-specific accounts and taxes.

Feel free to clone it and have a play - see [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) for an example setup. You'll need to supply your own API keys Note that this is an opinionated tool that I've built for personal use, not something I intend to formally "release" and support for anyone else.
